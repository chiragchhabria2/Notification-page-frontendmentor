# Frontend Mentor - Notifications page solution

This is a solution to the [Notifications page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/notifications-page-DqK5QAmKbC). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 





### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

Debugged and figured out some issues by myself and fixed them

```css
.notification {
   grid-template-areas: 
    "nimg" ,"ncontent";
}
```
Figured out this by debugging 
```js
const unreadNotificationsLength = unreadNotifications.length
```




### Continued development

I would like to make more javascript intensive projects and get more practice of CSS grids
